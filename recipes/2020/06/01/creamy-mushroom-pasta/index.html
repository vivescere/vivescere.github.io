<p>This took about 35min to make (I&rsquo;m not good at cleaning mushrooms). It&rsquo;s enough for 5 people, and is easy to make.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two small red onions (we only used half of a large onion)</li>
<li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
<li>A bit of vegetable stock</li>
<li>250g mushroom</li>
<li>3 tablespoons of tamari or soy sauce</li>
<li>250g of pasta (preferably wholemeal)</li>
<li>100g of cashew (preferably toasted cashews)</li>
<li>500ml of plant milk (no sugar milk)</li>
<li>The juice of a half lemon or lime</li>
<li>A teaspoon of salt</li>
<li>A teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
<li>Oregano or the herbs you prefer</li>
<li>A red chili or anything you want (we didn&rsquo;t put any)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>Clean the mushrooms.</li>
<li>Get a pan really hot. Warning : choose a large pan, as it will need to contain the pasta later on.</li>
<li>Add in the red onions and the garlic. Fry them (without adding oil), letting them sticking to the pan a bit. Wait until they&rsquo;re starting to turn brownish.</li>
<li>Add a little bit of vegetable stock, which is going to deglaze the onions and the garlic. When following the next steps, add stock as well if anything starts sticking to the pan.</li>
<li>Either mash the mushrooms or chop them into small pieces ; then add them in.</li>
<li>Add the tamari.</li>
<li>Start cooking the pasta, following the instructions on the pack.</li>
<li>In a high-speed blender, mix the cashews with the plant milk, the lemon/lime juice, the salt and the garlic powder. Wait until you have a creamy texture.</li>
<li>Add the cream in the pan, followed by the pasta ; use the pasta water to thin the sauce, which is probably going to be a little too thick.</li>
<li>Add your herbs on top, with the red chili chopped into thin slices.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>They were really good and light too! I&rsquo;d like to use different mushrooms to see how the taste will change.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d give them a 4.75/5.</p>

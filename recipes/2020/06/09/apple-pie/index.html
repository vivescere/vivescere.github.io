<p>This took about 3 hours and a half to make (I was really slow). It&rsquo;s enough for at least 5 people, and isn&rsquo;t easy, but isn&rsquo;t hard to make.</p>
<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>310g all-purpose flour (and a little bit extra if the dough gets sticky)</li>
<li>400g + 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon organic sugar</li>
<li>1 + 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>225g vegan butter (cubed and chilled)</li>
<li>6 tablespoons of ice water</li>
<li>7 apples (I only used 5)</li>
<li>1 lemon, zested (I didn&rsquo;t put this in)</li>
<li>1/2 lemon, juiced (I used a tablesppon of lemon juice)</li>
<li>5 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
<li>1 tablespoon coconut oil + 1 teaspoon</li>
<li>4 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ul>
<li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar (a tablespoon) and salt (a teaspoon).</li>
<li>Add the cubed butter, bit by bit, using a fork to work it into the flour until it breaks down.</li>
<li>Gradually add the ice water and mix until the dough can be pressed together.</li>
<li>Divide the dough in two parts, and shape them into discs. Wrap them in plastic and put them in the fridge for one hour.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.</li>
<li>Peel and core the apples, then cut them into thin slices. Put them in a large bowl and add sugar (200g), the lemon zest, cornstarch, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon of coconut oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 3 teaspoons cinnamon. Toss until the apples are well-coated.</li>
<li>On a lightly floured surface, roll both of the discs of dough to about 2cm thick. Transfer one to a greased 20cm pie dish, and gently press against the bottom and sides. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with a fork.</li>
<li>Pour the apples into the dish, and cover with the top crust. Trim the excess dough around the edges, then crimp the top and bottom crusts together with a fork.</li>
<li>Brush the top of the crust with a tablespoon of coconut oil, sprinkle a teaspoon of sugar and cinnamon.</li>
<li>Cut 4 vents in the top crust.</li>
<li>Bake for one hour, until the crust is starting to turn golden brown.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>It was delicious, altough really heavy. Maybe there was too much sugar this time, I&rsquo;d also like to try to perfect the top crust. The biggest pain point I can find is that it takes way too long to make - I spent almost the whole afternoon making it (because I&rsquo;m still really slow at cooking).</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;d give it a 4.75/5.</p>
